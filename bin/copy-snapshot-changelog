# So, git-xxx checks out from Git.
# But, before that, git-dch is run, and possibly  debian/changelog
# is not commited to git. -- I need to keep it there, to have increasing
# version number!
# So,  git-xxx would retrieve previous version.

# Work-around (?) for git-dch not being able to write to a specific file

# This works together with  ./snap, which creates the changelog!
